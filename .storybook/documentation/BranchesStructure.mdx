# Branches structure

- ```main``` - production branch with stable code that deploys to the production server.
Default branch in the project.

- ```develop``` - branch for the development server that includes the last changes
and is ready for QA after checking by the developer and lead. This branch
merges with the main after successful QA. The lead is a responsible person
for the successful merge.

- ```staging```(optional) - for the complex projects with a more strict review
structure allowed another environment. This is a mimic of the production
server with the same configuration and settings.
Merge flow in this case - ```develop -> staging -> main```.
In case of urgent hotfixes that would fix critical bugs, it allowed merging
them to the staging first to make the build and release process faster.
In this case merge process ```staging -> main```, ```staging -> develop```.

- ```feature``` and ```bugfix``` branches should be named with the ticket number e.g. ONIX-1234
